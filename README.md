_Pomme Plate_ is a collection of flat mockups you can use, remix, transform and share. You don't need to credit me in any way and you can use the work for commercial purpose.

_Pomme Plate_ means "Flat Apple" in French.

## Download
Rather than clone the entire project (an its history) head over to [releases](releases) to get the latest release.

## Overview
All mockups are available in SVG and PNG and Sketch project files.

I am not a designer. Although I find a certain harmony between the color I've chosen, your sharp, educated eye might tell you otherwise.

You can tweak the colors if necessary.

### iPhone ###

**Note:**
> iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus appear much bigger than they should be. That's because they have a 2208×1242 viewport downsampled to 1920×1080. Keeping the original screen resolution allows you to add screenshots; you'll then need to reduce the size of the whole thing (mockup + screenshot) by about 13.1%.

### iPad ###

**Note:**
> Once again, device sizes are depending on their resolution rather than their physical size. The iPad Mini is about 15.3% smaller than the iPad Air. The screen size of an iPad 3 or an iPad 4 is the same as the screen size of an iPad Air. Non retina devices are 50% bigger.

### MacBook ###

More Apple devices are on the way!
